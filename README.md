# cirq_hybrid_codes
Hybrid Qudit Surface Codes in [Google Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) are constructed in order to realize the Hilbert-Polya conjecture for arbitrary Artin L-functions and surface algebras. A running update to the paper [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) will be kept here so as not to bombard arXiv. 

Using [circulant matrices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05149.pdf#page10) we get the local Fourier transforms on the qudits. Using equivariant neural networks will likely prove useful for error correction of these generalized hybrid qudit surface codes (see for example [equivariant neural networks collection](https://github.com/Chen-Cai-OSU/awesome-equivariant-network). This gives us something like the renormalization group in physics and is likely a good model for human perception and generalizations of human perception to more complex intelligences. We note that the attention mechanism in transformer models such as GPT-3 is a permutation equivariant operation, and as such gives a way of approximating any finite group and therefore any compact group of symmetries in data. 

It is also possible that the spectral compatability constraints described in [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) given by gluing matrix rings gives a way of reducing the complexity of quantum computation. Moreover, it seems possible that semi-invariants of complete gentle algebras might be used as engineered features for improving error correction methods using deep learning. 

We also link to the (very sketchy) paper [Surface Algebras and Surface Orders II: Affine Bundles on Curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00621) as a way of undertsanding the problem geometrically.
