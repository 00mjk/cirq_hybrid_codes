# cirq_hybrid_codes
Hybrid Qudit Surface Codes in [Google Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) are constructed in order to realize the Hilbert-Polya conjecture for arbitrary Artin L-functions and surface algebras. A running update to the paper [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) will be kept here so as not to bombard arXiv. 

Using [circulant matrices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05149.pdf#page10) we get the local Fourier transforms on the qudits. Using equivariant neural networks will likely prove useful for error correction of these generalized hybrid qudit surface codes (see for example [equivariant neural networks collection](https://github.com/Chen-Cai-OSU/awesome-equivariant-network). This gives us something like the renormalization group in physics and is likely a good model for human perception and generalizations of human perception to more complex intelligences.
