Hybrid Qudit Surface Codes in [Google Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) are constructed in order to realize surface algebras as a truncated version of the Hilbert-Polya conjecture for low lying zeros of arbitrary Artin L-functions (see for example [Spectral Triples and Zeta-Cycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01715) for low lying zeros of zeta). We can extend this by taking powers of d and using qudits with dimension a power of d. This is equivalent to modding out by some power of the shift operator mentioned in [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) where Artin's conjecture was addressed. This of course can be translated into the language of partition functions, and zeros can be used for useful computation of phase-transitions in condensed matter physics. This model may also serve as a useful avenue for constructing features for use in machine learning models for quantum error correction using invariant theory and group equivariant neural networks. A running update to the paper [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) will be kept here so as not to bombard arXiv. 

Using [circulant matrices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05149.pdf#page10) we get the local finite Fourier transforms on the qudits. This implies a connection to *prolate spheroidal wave functions* investigated by Slepian and Polloch and mentioned in [Spectral Triples and Zeta-Cycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01715). Using equivariant neural networks will likely prove useful for error correction and control of these generalized hybrid qudit surface codes (see for example [Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs: Anisotropic Convolutions on Geometric Graphs](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Jnspzp-oIZE), [Surface Networks via General Covers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10705.pdf), [CNNs on Surfaces using Rotation-Equivariant Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01570.pdf), and [equivariant neural networks collection on Github](https://github.com/Chen-Cai-OSU/awesome-equivariant-network). Padding zeros was assumed to be the first obvious way to modify these neural networks, however, upon further inspection *the pullback of the matrix rings provides the correct dimension for these neural networks*. Geometrically one can consider the (Zariski) closed subset inside the direct sum given by the equations on diagonal entries defining the gluing of matrix the rings. We may also need to consider p-adic neural networks if p-adic geometry is being modeled, which is important to p-adic string theory and the p-adic AdS/CFT correspondence. 

Using group equivariant neural networks (can be constructed in such a way so that it gives us something like the renormalization group in physics?) and is likely a good model for human perception and generalizations of human perception to more complex intelligences. We note that the attention mechanism in transformer models such as GPT-3 is a permutation equivariant operation, and as such gives a way of approximating any finite group and therefore any compact group of symmetries in data. This could explain the generality in applicability of these models, but there are more efficient ways of capturing specific kinds symmetries and equivariance of features/data to specific symmetry groups by constructions in "geometric deep learning" using things like anisotropic filters and convolutional layers (and nonlinear/ReLU layers) that respect the symmetries.

It is also possible that the spectral compatability constraints described in [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) given by gluing matrix rings gives a way of reducing the complexity of quantum computation (this is related to geometric phase and the center of the algebra commuting with everything implying it is not observable in the sense of observables in physics and operator algebras). This may also have implications for the way we understand entanglement and [relative and global phases in quantum systems](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/guide/introducing-qubit-phase). Perhaps there are implications for quantization? Moreover, it seems possible that semi-invariants might be used as engineered features for improving error correction methods using deep learning. 

We also note that the p-adic geometry mentioned in [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) can be modeled as well such as in [From p-adic AdS/CFT to prospects in cold atoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh4cTozj3z4&t=1485s) and [p-adic AdS/CFT Correspondence](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/p-adic+AdS%2FCFT+correspondence). The patterns in information processing in p-adic geometry may be much different from those found in the complex setting. Algorithms using the p-adic geometry should be studied further to understand what applications might arise. The most obvious are phase transitions in quantum systems, cryptography, and control of quantum systems and quantum chaos. 

We also link to the (very sketchy) paper [Surface Algebras and Surface Orders II: Affine Bundles on Curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00621) as a way of undertsanding the problem geometrically. 

## Questions and Ideas

- Should we forgo the Hilbert space and represent states as operators? This would give a (noncommutative) spatial interpretation of the fiber product, and a relative tensor product intepretation of the noncommutative algebra of functions on that space would be the operators acting on the Hilbert space we converted into operators (so operator algebra acts on itself). Also, **relative tensor product** *same as* fiber product for surface algebras at the level of quivers IIRC (Check the Herschend papers referenced in SAI like [Herschend 4](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0022404907001508?token=FCD1A091C7FDB01F328CC40A2FB71C3D371FB3157A4D8DB7A47F2B7583D688A6CC2E30397D300FEA4A6768FDA16F22EA&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20210930022536) phrased in terms of representations so use direct sum of indecomposable projectives expression of the algebra, which gives us a bimodule structure and is likely related to Bobinski and [Zwara's](https://eudml.org/search/page?q=sc.general*op.AND*l_0*c_0author_0eq%253A1.Grzegorz+Zwara&qt=SEARCH) "Hom-controlled functors" which give geometric results on module varieties of different algebras which are related via a "Hom-controlled functor"; see for example [Schubert varieties and representations of Dynkin quivers](https://eudml.org/doc/284883)). 
- Use operator-state correspondence/density matrices and adjoint representation...use geometric phases (roots of unity) to generate more basis vectors...something something Okounkov's infinite wedge and diagonal operators. Hurwitz theory counting coverings of topological structures of operators (think bundles of operators on Riemann surface)...but what is the significance of counting coverings? Some kind of complexity theoretic interpretation in error correction/control of quantum systems?
- Even though local factors could all be finite dimensional (restriction imposed by gravity) if we look at noncompact Riemann surfaces with some n-ary tree (think hyperbolic upper half plane or Poincare disk and the AdS/CFT correspondence) then we get an uncountable number of factors which implies uncountable global dimension and the necessity of type III von Neumann algebra factors. Think Cantor filtration of modules over surface algebras. What does the module theory look like in this case? What do projective resolutions look like? Do we get interesting things that converge? What about module varieties? Invariant Theory?
- Also, if we take tensor products over rings (rather than just the complex numbers), what information do we get from the dimension viewed with respect to various fields or rings? 
- Center commutes with everything so is independent of any observable and therefore not observable? Also center is spectral and related to geometric phase of quantum system? If center is not observable then should be able to reduce complexity of computation using gluing?
- Truncate series for local interactions like a growing db-scan/persistent homology construction where the ball is expanding (at the speed of light?) How does entanglement propagate? Green’s function gives propagation of influence? Think about Wolfram's explanation of propagating hypermaps (which are essentially just dessins d'enfants); Also maybe Matilde Marcolli's graph grammers and insertion of graphs. What "langauge" is encoded in things like the cosmic microwave background? Related question: what wavelengths of microwaves interact with complex molecules, protiens, and larger organic structures? Could we understand Penrose's idea of encoding information in the cosmic microwave background in this way? 
- Also note there is a decomposition of (global) Hamiltonians

see comment on [Sean Carroll's video](https://youtu.be/3yofwdhQlhI). If we look at this from the perspective of patching things together locally rather than dividing things into subsystems globally, this may give some insight into how the global separation of von Neumann algebras should be separated into factors (of type I, II, and III). Also, we need to tensor over fields/rings other than complex numbers (relative tensor product) like p-adics for example,

and rings of integers or other rings R and S, (maybe p-adic integers/rationals and q-adic integers/rationals for two matrix algebras and tensor over lcm(p,q)-adics? Relatively prime p and q give interesting things?)

How does this relate to Connes Fusion? Is this the same thing? Maybe import language/theory from vertex operator algebras?
- Take surface algebra and it’s (Koszul) dual surface algebra together to get 4-D physics? How do they come together? Tensor? Gluing? Super Riemann surfaces? Should relate to mirror symmetry? 
- Differential on the dga structure of surface algebra recovers the topology of Riemann surface. Noncommutative connection defines curvature. Flat is important class of connections for surface algebras. 
- [Sean Carroll's video](https://youtu.be/3yofwdhQlhI) says at 1:01:25 "There is no representation of noncompact group on finite dimensional Hilbert space." What is he trying to say, because the way this is worded it simply isn't true. Does he need a specific kind of representation? Unitary or Faithful or some such? This is in regards to (approximate) Lorentz invariance/Diffeomorphism invariance/gauge invariance (what about equivariance?)
- Look at the Fourier transform from l^2(Z) to L^2(T) (and Zwara’s smooth morphisms of module schemes and Hom-controlled functors). This idea can be transferred to surface algebras/orders where we do F^{-1}M_fF: A \to A like at 44:30 in [Vaughn Jones' lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOucTCWylzk&t=3174s) to get convolution. See also Section 8 of [SA2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00621.pdf).
- Say more about unitary operators taking us from an algebra of operators to multiplication, use Fourier transform for example to go to irrational rotation algebra. Talk about realization of measure space $(X, \mu)$ as spectrum of operator. Maybe look at Lurie's categorification of Fourier transform?
- If Morita equivalence is the appropriate notion of "isomorphism" in noncommutative geometry (as apposed to say, isomorphisms of algebras) then derived equivalent categories should be important. There is a lot of work on this in the case of gentle algebras. The modules realized as paths idea works in the derived categories as well for indecomposable objest. For gentle algebras, this is all very algorithm/computer friendly. What important insights or applications can we gain from this?

- Use the universal localization via projectives of [Aiden Schofield](https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0246) and [Amnon Neeman, Andrew Ranicki, Aidan Schofield](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0205034) to get the Leavitt path algebra. This is closely related to the theory of semi-invariants described by maps between projective modules over the surface algebra. Next we should take the analytic completion of the Leavitt path algebras to obtain graph C-star-algebras. Some results on pullbacks such as [Leavitt vs. C∗ pullbacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09624) or [A graded pullback structure of Leavitt path algebras of trimmable graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10209) may be useful (as it may be easier to study certain aspects of the theory prior to taking pullbacks). Next we should use [The Noncommutative Geometry of Graph C∗-Algebras I: The Index Theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0508025) and other work of [A. Rennie](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Rennie%2C+A) to obtain the theory of spectral triples associated to graph C-star-algebras (if they exist) and noncommutative geometry. (Sorry for the 'star', markdown inteprets stars as italics). 

- Understanding how this relates to various kinds of factors of von Neumann algebras is also very important, but I can't say much about this yet. 

- Triangulations and their trivalent (Koszul/equivalently geometric) duals obviously give us (gentle) quivers with (super)potential and links to cluster algebras (see [DWZ1](https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0649) and [DWZ2](https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.0676), also [IOTW](https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0798)).

- Develop the appropriate gauge theory (similar to [Qudit surface codes and gauge theory with finite cyclic groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609070))

- Develop the theory of non-commutative fundamental groups (see [The fundamental group of a noncommutative space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10127))

- see if there are any applications of [Indecomposable representations of quivers on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0966) to [Quantum error correction on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0421) 

- Represent states as operators in a C*-algebra then allow a (topological structure) of operators inside this C*-algebra to act on these and generate some new structure of operators (could be the whole algebra but more interesting would be some bundle of operators over the Riemann sphere or other Riemann surfaces). Also allow coverings of topological structures of operators to act on the initial topological structure of operators. Think coverings of Riemann surfaces with bundles of operators. The tower of operators goes in both directions. We can think of this as coverings of noncommutative spaces and noncommutative spaces generated by actions of (topological structures of) C*-algebras. Should think of paths on the surface as modules/representations (or indecomposables in the derived category), lifting to sections. 


## Useful papers/ideas not referenced or linked on ArXiv

This paper is also very useful [The (cyclic) enhanced nilpotent cone via quiver
representations](https://d-nb.info/1180631099/34) and is not linked via connected papers on arXiv. 

Work of [Fomin and Zelevinsky](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9912128) is a good place to begin understanding total positivity in physics and how that relateds to Schubert varieties. This is directly relates to work of [Nima Arkani-Hamed](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04541) for example, and likely is implied by von Neumann algebras that with positive spectra in the reals (don't really understand types of factors I/II/III enough to say much yet). Should be some relation of total positivity to Okounkov's infinite wedge construction as well, still working on understanding the details of this. Wedge powers of density operators gives minors of density matrices though, so this is likely pretty straightforward to see how total positivity (of minors of matrices) enters the picture. For example, nth wedge power of a matrix gives the n-by-n minors of that matrix as the entries of the new matrix. This is important in constructions mentioned in Andy Carroll's article [Semi-Invariants for Gentle String Algebras](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0774) where minors are used to compute the decomposition of the coordinate ring of the varieties of complexes (which is related to partitions and likely gives the connection to Okounkov's paper [Infinite wedge and random partitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9907127)). Other references to this technique over arbitrary rings (as apposed to algebraically closed fields) include [Universal Complexes and the
Generic Structure of Free Resolutions](https://projecteuclid.org/JournalArticle/PreviewFirstPage?urlid=10.1307%2Fmmj%2F1008719036) and [On the variety of complexes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870881800047). This approach is somewhat different from that of Magyar's paper [Affine Schubert Varieties and Circular Complexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0210151) which gives the obvious connection to loop groups and the geometric Langland's program. However, the variety of complexes approach gives the connection to cluster algebras via quivers with potential when the quiver comes from a triangulated surface as apposed to an arbitrary dessin d'enfant. The potential in this case gives the gentle relations on the surface algebra. There are of course other related approaches such as those by Musili and Seshadri, but I am less familiar with these at the moment. 

It may be prudent to look into the work of Pierre-Guy Plamondon, Bernhard Keller, and Claire Amiot on cluster categories and gentle algebras. I have not looked at this in quite some time, so the connection and interpretation in terms of physics is not something I could make off the top of my head. However, the work is beautiful and likely would provide many interesting new ideas considering the geometric interpretation of indecomposable objects in the derived category of gentle algebras as paths on Riemann surfaces (similar to that of the indecomposable modules over gentle algebras).

## (Post??) Quantum Cryptography, Lattice Based Cryptography, and (Hyper)elliptic Cruve Cryptography

Probably this is wrong [Lattice stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography) but understanding why is going to require understanding lattices over orders and how to use quantum computers to model them. Lattices over order are described in:
-[Lattices Over Orders I](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/cirq_hybrid_codes/blob/master/lattices-over-orders-I.pdf)

-[Lattices Over Orders II](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/cirq_hybrid_codes/blob/master/lattices-over-orders-II.pdf)

-[Methods of Representation Theory: with Applications to Finite Groups and Orders vol. 1](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/cirq_hybrid_codes/blob/master/methods-of-representation-theory-I.pdf)

-[Methods of Representation Theory: with Applications to Finite Groups and Orders vol. 2](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/cirq_hybrid_codes/blob/master/methods-of-representation-theory-II.pdf)

-[Representation Theory of Finite Groups and Associative Algebras](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/cirq_hybrid_codes/blob/master/representation-theory-of-finite-groups-and-associative-algebras.pdf)

The specific interpretation of lattices over orders in terms of gentle surface algebras is described in [SA1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) and [SA2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00621), which is partially based on work of Roggenkamp (among others) on "graph orders". The interpretation in terms of quantum computing is something I'm currently working on understanding and writing up. Basic idea, assign a qudit to vertex of dessin where d(x) is valency of vertex x (or take some power of d(x)), then use operator-state correspondence/density operators instead of state vectors, then use the matrix rings/orders to do number theory/lattices, which (hopefully) gives connection to lattice based cryptography. Since this is all modeled as a dessin, should be able to interpret lattice based cryptography as hyperelliptic curve cryptography and vice-versa?? Will this make lattice based cryptography obsolete as a post quantum cryptography since everything can be modeled using qudits?
