Hybrid Qudit Surface Codes in [Google Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) are constructed in order to realize surface algebras as a truncated version of the Hilbert-Polya conjecture for low lying zeros of arbitrary Artin L-functions (see for example [Spectral Triples and Zeta-Cycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01715) for low lying zeros of zeta). We can extend this by taking powers of d and using qudits with dimension a power of d. This is equivalent to modding out by some power of the shift operator mentioned in [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750). This of course can be translated into the language of partition functions, and zeros can be used for useful computation of phase-transitions in condensed matter physics. This model may also serve as a useful avenue for constructing features for use in machine learning models for quantum error correction using invariant theory and group equivariant neural networks. A running update to the paper [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) will be kept here so as not to bombard arXiv. 

Using [circulant matrices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05149.pdf#page10) we get the local finite Fourier transforms on the qudits. This implies a connection to *prolate spheroidal wave functions* investigated by Slepian and Polloch and mentioned in [Spectral Triples and Zeta-Cycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01715). Using equivariant neural networks will likely prove useful for error correction of these generalized hybrid qudit surface codes (see for example [Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs: Anisotropic Convolutions on Geometric Graphs](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Jnspzp-oIZE), [Surface Networks via General Covers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10705.pdf), [CNNs on Surfaces using Rotation-Equivariant Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01570.pdf), and [equivariant neural networks collection on Github](https://github.com/Chen-Cai-OSU/awesome-equivariant-network). Padding zeros was assumed to be the first obvious way to modify these neural networks, however, upon further inspection *the pullback of the matrix rings provides the correct dimension for these neural networks*. Geometrically one can consider the (Zariski) closed subset inside the direct sum given by the equations on diagonal entries defining the gluing of matrix the rings. 

Using group equivariant neural networks gives us something like the renormalization group in physics and is likely a good model for human perception and generalizations of human perception to more complex intelligences. We note that the attention mechanism in transformer models such as GPT-3 is a permutation equivariant operation, and as such gives a way of approximating any finite group and therefore any compact group of symmetries in data. 

It is also possible that the spectral compatability constraints described in [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) given by gluing matrix rings gives a way of reducing the complexity of quantum computation. This may also have implications for the way we understand entanglement. Moreover, it seems possible that semi-invariants might be used as engineered features for improving error correction methods using deep learning. 

We also note that the p-adic geometry mentioned in [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) can be modeled as well such as in [From p-adic AdS/CFT to prospects in cold atoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh4cTozj3z4&t=1485s) and [p-adic AdS/CFT Correspondence](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/p-adic+AdS%2FCFT+correspondence).

We also link to the (very sketchy) paper [Surface Algebras and Surface Orders II: Affine Bundles on Curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00621) as a way of undertsanding the problem geometrically. 

This paper is also very useful [The (cyclic) enhanced nilpotent cone via quiver
representations](https://d-nb.info/1180631099/34) and is not linked via connected papers on arXiv.
