# cirq_hybrid_codes
Hybrid Qudit Surface Codes in Google Cirq are constructed in order to realize the Hilbert-Polya conjecture and surface algebras. A running update to the paper [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) will be kept here so as not to bombard arXiv. Comments provided by reviewers and a running checklist will also be kept here.
